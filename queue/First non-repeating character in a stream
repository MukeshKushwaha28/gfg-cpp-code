Given an input stream of A of n characters consisting only of lower case alphabets. The task is to find the first non repeating character, each time a character is inserted to the stream. If there is no such character then append '#' to the answer.
 

Example 1:

Input: A = "aabc"
Output: "a#bb"
Explanation: For every character first non
repeating character is as follow-
"a" - first non-repeating character is 'a'
"aa" - no non-repeating character so '#'
"aab" - first non-repeating character is 'b'
"aabc" - first non-repeating character is 'b'
Example 2:

Input: A = "zz"
Output: "z#"
Explanation: For every character first non
repeating character is as follow-
"z" - first non-repeating character is 'z'
"zz" - no non-repeating character so '#'
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function FirstNonRepeating() which takes A as input parameter and returns a string after processing the input stream.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(26 * n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(26)
